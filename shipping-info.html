                <h2><i classThe search results show multiple references to "shipping-info.html" in various files, indicating that the shipping info page is linked but the actual content might be missing or empty.

Since the shipping-info.html file appears to be empty or not returning content when read, it is likely that the file lacks the necessary HTML content to display shipping information.

Plan:
- Read the shipping-info.html file again to confirm if it is empty or has minimal content.
- If empty, create or update shipping-info.html with proper shipping information content.
- Verify links to shipping-info.html from other pages are correct.
- Test the shipping info page to ensure it displays the expected output.

Dependent files:
- shipping-info.html (main file to edit)
- Possibly other pages linking to shipping-info.html (for verification)

Follow-up steps:
- After updating shipping-info.html, test the page in a browser or local server.
- Confirm the shipping info output is displayed correctly.

Please confirm if I should proceed with reading shipping-info.html again and then updating it with proper content if needed. Or if you want to provide the current content of shipping-info.html for me to review first.
